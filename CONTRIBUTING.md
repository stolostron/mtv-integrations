Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.

## Contributing A Patch

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
1. The [repo owners](OWNERS) will respond to your issue promptly.
1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Submit a pull request.

## Issue and Pull Request Management

Anyone may comment on issues and submit reviews for pull requests. However, in
order to be assigned an issue or pull request, you must be a member of the
[open-cluster-management](https://github.com/open-cluster-management) GitHub organization.

Repo maintainers can assign you an issue or pull request by leaving a
`/assign <your Github ID>` comment on the issue or pull request.

## Pre-check before submitting a PR

After your PR is ready to commit, please run following commands to check your code.
```bash
make compile
```

### Testing your change
Make sure your `kubectl` context is set to your target cluster.
This will run the code locally:
#### Controller
```bash
./bin/manager
```
You will see the log output on the console. Provision a NEW cluster in ACM with `spec.installAttemptsLimit: 0` and you will see the controller launch a job.  Monitor the job with `oc logs jobs/cluster-curator-job-XYZAB` Where the job name is found using `oc get jobs`. The jobs are run in the cluster namespace.

## Build binaries
Make sure your code compiled (passed).
```bash
make build
```

## Build docker
Make sure you have docker.
```shell
export REPOSITORY_BASE=my.repository/repo_name/   # The trailing slash is required
make docker-build
```

## Push docker image
Make sure your docker is authenticated to the repository target
```shell
export REPOSITORY_BASE=my.repository/repo_name/   # The trailing slash is required
make docker-push
```

Now, you can follow the [getting started guide](./README.md) to work with the open-cluster-management hypershift-deployment-controller repository.
